Game  = Crazy Eights

Rules from Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crazy_Eights):

Five cards are dealt to each player (or seven in a two-player game).[4] The remaining cards of the deck are placed face down
at the center of the table. The top card is then turned face up to start the game.

Players discard by matching rank or suit with the top card of the discard pile, starting with the player left of the dealer.
They can also play any 8 at any time. If a player is unable to match the rank or suit of the top card of the discard pile
and does not have an 8, they draw a card from the stockpile. When a player plays an 8, they must declare the suit that the
next player is to play; that player must then follow the named suit or play another 8.

As an example: Once 6â™£ is played the next player:
  -can play any of the other 6s
  -can play any of the clubs
  -can play any 8 (then must declare a suit)
  -can draw from the stockpile until willing and able to play one of the above

The game ends as soon as one player has emptied their hand. That player collects a payment from each opponent equal to the
point score of the cards remaining in that opponent's hand. 8s score 50, court cards 10 and all other cards face value. If
the players run out of cards in the deck, the player with the lowest point score in their hand scores the difference between
that hand and each opponent's hand.[1]

The winner of the game is the first player to reach a specific number of points. For two players it is 100 points,
three players 150, four 200, five 250, six 300 and for seven players 350.
